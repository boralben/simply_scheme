# Simply Scheme Problem Sets

My solutions to problem sets from [Simply Scheme](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html)

## Dialect
These files will be written using [Chicken Scheme](https://www.call-cc.org/) version 5.2.0.

## Helper Files
I couldn't get the FTP connection provided in Appendix A to connect, but then I found a [downloads directory](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/downloads/simply/) with the files.
